Dear Students,  

My name is Praba Siva, and I have been working in the IT industry for last 30 years primarily focused on Architecture, Engineering, Data Management, Data Science and general IT operation. I have a master's degree in applied mathematics from the University of Michigan. I have been teaching at Franklin University for more than 2 years. I am in Columbus, OH area and in Eastern Time Zone (EST).  

Welcome you all to the class!  

We will have a weekly class at 6.00 pm EST on one of the weekdays (except Thursday and Friday), which is convenient for most of the students.  

For general questions, please leverage the announcement feature in the Canvas (https://franklin.instructure.com/courses/17935/announcements) The best way to reach out to me is email (through canvas or Ed Discussion or direct email) and I will check the email throughout the day and will respond within a day.   

Please let me know if you are using Mac or PC. This is hands-on class. 

Best Regards,  
-Praba
